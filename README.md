# Nerdbook - E2E Lab

In this lab, you will write end-to-end (e2e) tests in Cypress.

## Getting Started

1. Start by cloning this repository.

2. Open it in VSCode.

3. Install the dependencies from the VSCode terminal:

```bash
$ npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. Open another terminal in VSCode (leave the dev server running), and start Cypress:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

Cypress will open, choose E2E (end-to-end) testing, and choose Chrome or Firefox.

The tests for this social media app for developers (Nerdbook) are in the `0-nerdbook` folder. The two other folders contain examples for you to help
you on your testing journey.

Run the tests. You should see Grace Hopper sign up.
